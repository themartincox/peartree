# Gmail App Password Setup Instructions for Pear Tree Dental

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Enable automated email confirmations for membership applications by configuring Gmail App Password authentication.

## ðŸ“§ Current Email System Status
- **Email Service**: Configured with Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP
- **Recipients**: 3 practice email addresses for internal notifications
- **Patient Confirmations**: Professional HTML emails with practice branding
- **Backup System**: âœ… Active (applications saved even if email fails)
- **Status**: Requires Gmail App Password to go live

## ðŸ”§ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. **Sign in to Google Account**: Use the main practice Gmail account (hello@peartree.dental)
2. **Go to Security Settings**: https://myaccount.google.com/security
3. **Enable 2-Step Verification**: If not already enabled
4. **Verify your phone number** and complete the setup

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. **Return to Security Settings**: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. **Find "App Passwords"**: Under "Signing in to Google" section
3. **Select App**: Choose "Mail"
4. **Select Device**: Choose "Other (Custom name)"
5. **Enter Name**: "Pear Tree Dental Website"
6. **Generate Password**: Google will provide a 16-character password
7. **Copy the Password**: Save it securely (you won't see it again)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
The website needs these environment variables set in Netlify:

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=hello@peartree.dental
EMAIL_PASS=[16-character-app-password-from-step-2]
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Pear Tree Dental Centre
```

### Step 4: Update Netlify Environment Variables
1. **Log in to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Select the site**: same-f22m1i6mlsh-latest
3. **Go to Site Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. **Add the following variables**:
   - `EMAIL_USER`: hello@peartree.dental
   - `EMAIL_PASS`: [paste the 16-character app password]
   - `EMAIL_HOST`: smtp.gmail.com
   - `EMAIL_PORT`: 587
   - `EMAIL_SECURE`: false
   - `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`: Pear Tree Dental Centre

### Step 5: Test the Email System
1. **Redeploy the site** (environment variables require a new build)
2. **Test email endpoint**: Visit `/api/test-email`
3. **Submit a test membership application**
4. **Check all email inboxes**:
   - hello@peartree.dental
   - reception@peartree.dental
   - practice@peartree.dental

## ðŸ“‹ Email Templates Overview

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

### App Password Security
- **App passwords bypass 2FA**: Treat them like account passwords
- **Unique per application**: Each app should have its own password
- **Revocable**: Can be revoked individually if compromised
- **Limited scope**: Only for SMTP, not full account access

### Best Practices
- **Store securely**: Don't save in plain text files
- **Monitor usage**: Check for unauthorized email sending
- **Regular rotation**: Consider changing annually
- **Backup access**: Ensure multiple staff can manage if needed

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Invalid credentials" error**
   - âœ… Verify 2FA is enabled
   - âœ… Check app password is correct (no spaces)
   - âœ… Confirm EMAIL_USER matches the Google account

2. **"Less secure app access" error**
   - âœ… Use App Password, not regular password
   - âœ… Ensure account has 2FA enabled

3. **Emails not sending**
   - âœ… Check Netlify environment variables
   - âœ… Verify EMAIL_PORT=587 and EMAIL_SECURE=false
   - âœ… Test with `/api/test-email` endpoint

4. **Emails going to spam**
   - âœ… Check sender reputation
   - âœ… Verify SPF/DKIM records (advanced)
   - âœ… Use practice domain email for best delivery
