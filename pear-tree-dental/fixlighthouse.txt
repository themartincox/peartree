potential fixes for mobile

⸻

Mobile fix plan (priority-ordered)

1) LCP: make the hero image a true, eager LCP

Your LCP is the hero <Image> but it’s missing priority/fetchPriority="high" and it’s getting delayed by CSS.

Do this on the homepage hero image:

import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src="/images/heroes/pear-tree-home-hero-full.webp"
  alt="Pear Tree Dental modern practice background"
  fill
  priority
  fetchPriority="high"
  sizes="100vw"
  // ensure no lazy here (priority disables lazy)
  className="object-cover object-top"
/>

And in your <Head> for the homepage:

<link rel="preload" as="image"
  href="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1920&q=85"
  imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=640&q=85 640w,
               /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1080&q=85 1080w,
               /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1920&q=85 1920w"
  imagesizes="100vw"
/>

(This eliminates the “LCP request discovery” delay and typically drops LCP by 600–1200 ms on Slow 4G.)

⸻

2) Right-size the three “too large for display” images

Lighthouse shows several _next/image URLs rendered ~376×263 but fetched ~750×477. Fix by tightening sizes in those components so Next only serves ~400–500 px variants on mobile.

Pattern to use on cards/thumbnails:

<Image
  src={src}
  alt={alt}
  width={750}
  height={477}
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 48vw, (max-width: 1024px) 33vw, 376px"
/>

	•	That last fallback 376px matches your rendered size → removes the 41 KB, 29 KB, 23 KB over-fetches Lighthouse flagged.
	•	For the Clearbit favicon (125×128 shown at 16×16), serve a 32×32 PNG and let the browser scale down: cache it locally as /favicons/clearbit-google.png and stop fetching the 125× version.

⸻

3) Lazy-load noncritical art above the fold (the “Smiling family”)

Lighthouse shows a 95.9 KB offscreen image during initial render. Make sure it’s below the fold and lazy:

<Image
  src="/images/heroes/hero-home-new-family.webp"
  alt="Smiling family at Pear Tree Dental"
  width={1200} height={900}
  loading="lazy"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 90vw, (max-width: 1024px) 75vw, 1200px"
/>

If it’s visually above the fold on some viewports, apply a CSS min-height to push it slightly lower on mobile or render it after the first content block.

⸻

4) Kill render-blocking CSS (≈300 ms)

You’ve got two CSS files blocking first paint: b451bf9ddb...css (1.3 KB) and c9c56f09...css (~21 KB, 17 KB unused).

Actions:
	•	Purge Tailwind aggressively: confirm your tailwind.config.ts content: covers all /src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx} and remove any broad safelists you’re not using.
	•	Split critical CSS for the homepage only (optional but impactful): move hero-above-the-fold styling into component-scoped classes (Tailwind utilities already inline via class names—avoid extra global CSS).
	•	Inline tiny critical @font-face & use font-display: swap if not already.

⸻

5) Reduce unused JS (≈28 KB) & legacy transforms (≈11 KB)

You’ve got a ~37 KB chunk (2565-*.js) and “legacy features” polyfills shipping to modern phones.

Ship modern only:
	•	Add a modern browserslist so SWC stops transpiling Baseline features:

// package.json
"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    "chrome >= 100",
    "edge >= 100",
    "safari >= 15.4",
    "firefox >= 100",
    "ios_saf >= 15.4"
  ],
  "development": ["last 1 chrome version"]
}

	•	If that chunk contains carousels/reviews/video logic, code-split them:

const ReviewsRail = dynamic(() => import("./ReviewsRail"), { ssr: false });

Then mount it after first paint (e.g., inside an useEffect gate or below the fold).
	•	Remove any global polyfills and old helpers you no longer need.

⸻

6) Preconnect the analytics queue and defer 3P

Lighthouse suggests preconnecting Simple Analytics queue.

In <Head> (root layout):

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://logo.clearbit.com">

Load SA with defer and quiet mode:

<script async defer src="https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com/latest.js"></script>
<noscript><img src="https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com/noscript.gif" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"/></noscript>

(You’re already lightweight here; preconnect shaves ~200–300 ms on Slow 4G.)

⸻

7) Fix the _next/image 400 (Bad Request) console errors

400s usually mean a bad q or an unsupported src (e.g., missing leading slash, unencoded URL, or remote pattern not allowed).

Checklist:
	•	Ensure all src are local (start with /) or, for remotes, add domains/patterns to next.config.js images.remotePatterns.
	•	Keep q between 1–100.
	•	Avoid passing undefined into src on first render; guard with {src && <Image …/>}.

⸻

8) Headers: CSP, HSTS, COOP, cache TTL

You can solve four Best-Practices warnings and the short TTLs via netlify.toml.

# netlify.toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
  Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = "same-origin"
  Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://*; script-src 'self' https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com; media-src 'self' data:; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; require-trusted-types-for 'script';"
  # Optional: set a sane default cache
  Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"

# Longer cache for your static helpers
[[headers]]
  for = "/auto-events.js"
  [headers.values]
  Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/proxy.js"
  [headers.values]
  Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

Tune CSP as needed for any extra domains (maps, fonts, etc.).

⸻

9) Accessibility quick wins (to push 92 → 98–100)
	•	Contrast (Membership CTAs): darken background or increase text contrast:
	•	Replace bg-pear-gold with bg-pear-gold-dark and the text with text-white + font-semibold; test with a contrast checker to hit ≥4.5:1.
	•	Heading order: the “Meekz” element should not be h5. Make it a <p> or visually styled span; keep headings hierarchical in sections.
	•	Touch targets (carousel dots are 6×6 px):

<button class="w-6 h-6 md:w-5 md:h-5 rounded-full ...">...</button>

Minimum 48×48 CSS px is WCAG-friendly; visually you can center a smaller dot inside a larger invisible hit area using padding or pseudo-elements.

	•	Video captions: add a <track kind="captions" srclang="en" src="/captions/assessment.vtt" default> to the assessment video.

⸻

10) DOM size hygiene (not urgent)

1,217 nodes is OK, but the hero stack has 58 direct children. If you can, merge nested wrappers and remove unused decorative layers. It marginally helps style calc times.

⸻

TL;DR change list you can ship now
	1.	Add priority fetchPriority="high" sizes="100vw" to the hero <Image> and preload it in <Head>.
	2.	Tighten sizes for card images to cap mobile fetch ~376–420 px; localize/CROP the Clearbit logo to 32×32.
	3.	Ensure big “family” image is lazy and below fold.
	4.	Purge Tailwind more aggressively; trim global CSS.
	5.	Add a modern browserslist; dynamically import heavy rails; remove legacy polyfills.
	6.	Preconnect SA domains; keep SA deferred.
	7.	Fix _next/image 400s (remote patterns, valid q, leading slash).
	8.	Add Netlify headers for HSTS, COOP, CSP (with Trusted Types), and long-cache /auto-events.js + /proxy.js.
	9.	Raise contrast on membership CTAs; fix heading order; enlarge touch targets; add video captions.
	10.	(Nice-to-have) Reduce wrapper divs in the hero.



potential fixes for desktop

Awesome—desktop is already flying (97 Perf). Let’s mop up the remaining flags and lock in 100/95+/95+/100.

Below is a delta plan from your desktop report (only what’s left to fix vs mobile list). I’ve included copy-paste snippets.

⸻

Desktop delta (priority-ordered)

1) LCP polish (browser hints + exact sizes)

Lighthouse still nudges “fetchpriority=high should be applied” and shows CSS delaying render.

Hero image component (homepage):

<Image
  src="/images/heroes/pear-tree-home-hero-full.webp"
  alt="Pear Tree Dental modern practice background"
  fill
  priority
  fetchPriority="high"
  sizes="100vw"
  className="object-cover object-top"
/>

Preload in <Head> (homepage only):

<link rel="preload" as="image"
  href="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1920&q=85"
  imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=640&q=85 640w,
               /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1080&q=85 1080w,
               /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fheroes%2Fpear-tree-home-hero-full.webp&w=1920&q=85 1920w"
  imagesizes="100vw">

Also: Preconnect to analytics (saves ~80 ms in your report):

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com" crossorigin>


⸻

2) Image right-sizing on desktop cards (Lighthouse “Improve image delivery”)

Two thumbnails are over-fetched (render ~711×498 and ~810×455). Tighten sizes so Next serves closer to the displayed size.

Pattern for desktop cards:

<Image
  src={src}
  alt={alt}
  width={1080} height={607} // or your source aspect
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 60vw, (max-width: 1280px) 40vw, 810px"
/>

	•	Use a meaningful final fallback (711px / 810px) per block.
	•	You can also lower default quality a touch for non-hero images (q≈70–75) if you pass quality={75}.

next.config.js (ensure AVIF & proper deviceSizes):

// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [320, 420, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1536, 1920],
  },
};

Clearbit tiny icon: cache locally at 32×32 and serve that (stops the 4.3 KiB waste + external request):

/public/favicons/clearbit-google-32.png

Then reference that instead of logo.clearbit.com.

⸻

3) CLS = 0.045 from the “Smiling family” art & fixed reviews widget

Two culprits:

A) Decorative “family” image in a section.relative
Ensure it’s lazy and the container reserves space (so it doesn’t shift when image resolves).

<section className="relative min-h-[38rem]"> {/* reserve height */}
  <div className="block">
    <div className="relative">
      <Image
        src="/images/heroes/hero-home-new-family.webp"
        alt=""
        fill
        loading="lazy"
        sizes="100vw"
        className="object-cover object-[12%_center] opacity-50"
        priority={false}
      />
      {/* foreground content here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

B) Fixed reviews widget is “unsized” and causes shift when injected. Give it a fixed size from the start and avoid moving its top via JS.

<div
  className="fixed right-6 z-50 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg reviews-widget-wrapper"
  style={{ top: 122, width: 360, height: 120 }}  // reserve space
  data-testid="googlereviews-widget"
>
  {/* inner */}
</div>

If the widget content height varies, start hidden with opacity:0; transform:translateY(0) and do not animate layout properties like top; fade it in without moving.

⸻

4) Defer offscreen decorative image (95.9 KiB saving)

Lighthouse flags the same “family” image as offscreen. The snippet above (loading="lazy") plus the height reservation solves both CLS and offscreen fetch waste.

⸻

5) Render-blocking CSS (two files) & unused CSS (~16 KiB)
	•	Verify Tailwind purge paths cover all sources:

// tailwind.config.ts
content: [
  "./src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}",
  "./src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}",
  "./src/lib/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
]

	•	Remove unused safelists.
	•	Keep heavy, page-specific styles inside components (i.e., Tailwind utility classes) instead of global CSS.
	•	If you still want to chase the last few ms: inline a tiny critical snippet and lazy-load a non-critical CSS chunk (optional).

⸻

6) Legacy JS (~11 KiB) & Unused JS (~27 KiB)

Same fix as mobile:

Modern browserslist to reduce transforms/polyfills:

"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    "chrome >= 100",
    "edge >= 100",
    "safari >= 15.4",
    "firefox >= 100",
    "ios_saf >= 15.4"
  ],
  "development": ["last 1 chrome version"]
}

Code-split noncritical UI (reviews rail, video sections, big carousels):

import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const ReviewsRail = dynamic(() => import("./ReviewsRail"), { ssr: false });

Mount below the fold to keep the main chunk lean.

⸻

7) Console errors: _next/image 400 & video  ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED

_next/image 400 → usually invalid src, missing remote pattern, or q out of range.

Checklist:
	•	All local images start with / (no unencoded query strings).
	•	For remote images (if any), add to images.remotePatterns in next.config.js.
	•	Ensure you never render <Image src={undefined}>—guard the component.

Video /images/treatment-journey/assessment.mp4
	•	Verify the path actually exists in /public/images/treatment-journey/assessment.mp4.
	•	Keep preload="metadata" (you already do) and add captions (also fixes an a11y item):

<video
  class="w-full h-full object-cover"
  poster="/images/treatment-journey/assessment-poster.webp"
  autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"
  aria-label="Comprehensive dental examination and digital imaging technology"
>
  <source src="/images/treatment-journey/assessment.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track kind="captions" srclang="en" src="/captions/assessment.vtt" default>
</video>


⸻

8) Best Practices 74 → 95+ (CSP, HSTS, COOP, geolocation request)

Add security headers and move geolocation behind a user gesture.

netlify.toml headers

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
  Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = "same-origin"
  Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https:; script-src 'self' https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com; media-src 'self' data:; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; require-trusted-types-for 'script';"

(Adjust CSP domains for any extras—maps, fonts, etc.)

Geolocation (only on click):

// before: runs on load → Lighthouse warning
// after: only on user action
function requestLocation() {
  navigator.permissions?.query({ name: 'geolocation' as PermissionName })
    .then(() => navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(pos => {/* use it */}))
    .catch(() => {/* graceful fallback */});
}
// Button
<button onClick={requestLocation}>Find nearest route</button>


⸻

9) Accessibility quick wins (same as mobile)
	•	Contrast: make “Membership” chips/links meet ≥4.5:1 (use bg-pear-gold-dark + text-white + font-semibold).
	•	Heading order: replace the “Meekz” h5 with a <p> or ensure heading levels don’t skip.
	•	Touch targets: dots and small links must have a 48×48 hit area (wrap tiny dot inside a larger button).

Example:

<button aria-label="Go to review 1"
  class="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 p-0 rounded-full focus:outline-none">
  <span class="block w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-white/70"></span>
</button>


⸻

10) Caching tweaks (repeat visits)

You’ve got short TTLs (/auto-events.js 3h; /proxy.js 7d). If they’re static, make them long-cache:

[[headers]]
  for = "/auto-events.js"
  [headers.values]
  Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/proxy.js"
  [headers.values]
  Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"


⸻

Quick checklist to reach 100/95+/95+/100 on desktop
	•	Hero image: priority + fetchPriority="high" + preload link.
	•	Tight sizes on desktop cards; drop icon to 32×32 local.
	•	Decorative “family” image: lazy + container height reserved.
	•	Reviews widget: fixed width/height; fade in without moving layout.
	•	Purge Tailwind + reduce global CSS.
	•	Modern browserslist; code-split noncritical UI.
	•	Fix _next/image 400s; verify video file path; add <track>.
	•	Add Netlify headers (CSP/HSTS/COOP/Trusted Types).
	•	Gate geolocation behind click.
	•	Contrast, heading order, and 48×48 tap targets.
